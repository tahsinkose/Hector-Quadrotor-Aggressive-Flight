# Hector-Quadrotor-Aggressive-Flight
Implementation of the algorithms offered in the paper <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~gabeh/papers/GNC08_QuadTraj.pdf">Quadrotor Helicopter Trajectory Tracking Control</a> originally  for the STARMAC platform. In this case, it is implemented for Hector Quadrotor using ROS as the framework. Outputs of several patterns and trajectories are taken from RViz.
